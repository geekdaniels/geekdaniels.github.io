           <blockquote>″There is a say that! Your Destiny Define Your Destination Weather You Get There Or Not Depend On Your Determination.″</blockquote>
            
             <p>
                 Jeffson Odiete Avwerosuo is the  founder of the Jeffson's Foundation, a non- governmental organisation, with the main aim of providing a helping hand to the less-privileged within the Nigerian society through humanitarian activities.
                  <br />
                  
Because of his passion for the future of the African child and his desire to see Africa become a better place, in addition to his interest for mother-child-health care and scientific research in public health, Odiete set up the Jeffson's Foundation.<br /></p>
<p>
Odeite right from childhood had nursed the desire and dream of becoming a world class health care giver and a philantropist.<br />

Odeite who holds an A' Levels certificate from Amadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria, is presently a student in one of Nigeria's leading private universities; Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo.<br /><br />

Prior to studying at Ajayi Crowther, Odiete had worked  as a presenter with the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), where he has well over 10 jingles and 20 voice-over to his credit.<br /><br />

Odiete who is the first Shift Ambassador for the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Region 10, has professional certificates in  many health care certified courses including Mother-to-child transmission of HIV, Antimicrobial Resistance stage one and two, HIV stigma and Discrimination, all of which he received from the Global Health eLearning Centre (an organisation sponsored by Johns Hopkins BLOOMBERG School of Public Health and USAID).</p>

<p>
Apart from the aforementioned, Odeite has also participated in other professional certificates in public health such as improving health care quality, fostering change in health services, improving the lives of young vulnerable children and their care givers and special considerations for highly vulnerable children and their care givers to mention a few.<br /><br />

    Due to his flair for medical service provision, he was accepted to work with the Nigerian Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), medical hospital where his knowledge about health care was put to test. He however succeeded in proving his worth while working with the NNPC Medical hospital as a result, he was given honorary membership certificate to be a part of the Okikiolu Kayode Visionary Class (O.K.V.C), an adjunct of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)., Abuja.</p>
<p>
Odiete, apart from being a guru in the health sciences, is a rising Nigerian gospel artist, who is already making headways in the Nigerian gospel entertainment industry, with 7 hit singles to his name. Of prominent is his  song 'Olorun lese ' which is a remake of Deitrick Haddon's song He's Able.<br />

He has worked with big names like Kenny K'ore, Kingley   , Big Bolaji, Nathaniel Bassey and a host of many others.<br />

Due to his tremendous contribution to youth development,  he recently received an award from the Ajayi Crowther University Student Assembly (ACUSA) as the most enterprising student. He has also been nominated for various gospel awards of recent is the Annual Universities Crest Award (ANUCA).
<p>
Odeite is a young man with the hope and vision of changing the the fate of destitutes around Nigeria and by extension the world. His dream is to put a smile on every individual's face through a committed service to humanity and God.<br />

Part of his humanitarian activities include visiting orphanages, providing materials for widows and children, visiting juvenile homes and rehabilitation centres, organising trade-fairs, free-health care services for the aged and the poor who cannot access these services. He has organised many training sessions for students within and outside the school environ as a way of taking the minds of these youths from social vices, with a view to make them become more responsible citizens of the Nigerian society.<br /><br />

Nothing defines Jeffson Odeite better than a pace setter.
